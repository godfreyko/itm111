<p><strong>Course Syllabus</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>"We have thousands of times more available information than Thomas Jefferson or Abraham Lincoln. Yet which of us would think ourselves a thousand times more educated or more serviceable to our fellowmen than they? The sublime quality of what these two men gave to us—including the Declaration of Independence and the Gettysburg Address—was not attributable to their great resources of information, for their libraries were comparatively small by our standards. Theirs was the wise and inspired use of a limited amount of information. Available information wisely used is far more valuable than multiplied information allowed to lie fallow." -&nbsp;Dallin H. Oaks</p>
<p><strong>Course Description</strong></p>
<p>This course teaches the basic elements of database management systems. It introduces students to the concepts of logical and physical relationships in a data model and the concept of inner join. Students will use a computer aided software engineering (CASE) tool to design, create, and query a database.</p>

</div>
<div class="beforeTheWeekBegins">
<h2>Before the Week Begins</h2>
<ul>
<li>Students will go over preparation materials and complete the preparation check before class on Monday.</li>

<li>Consider reviewing the teaching tips and suggestions in the CIT111 - W03 Course Group discussion <a href="https://byui.instructure.com/courses/70298/discussion_topics/1457734" data-api-endpoint="https://byui.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/70298/discussion_topics/1457734" data-api-returntype="Discussion">https://byui.instructure.com/courses/70298/discussion_topics/1457734</a>.</li>

<h2>During the Week</h2>
<ul>
<h3>First of the week:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The students should have completed the preparation materials and check before the first class of the week and be ready for learning, activities, and discussions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>(W03 - Big Data)</h3>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><a class="" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAZ8lK224Kw" data-preview-alt="THE HUMAN FACE OF BIG DATA | Trailer | PBS">THE HUMAN FACE OF BIG DATA | Trailer | PBS</a></li>
<li>Discuss how data is helping to build the kingdom (gather Israel) with Geneology data. President Nelson has said that "the gathering is &ldquo;<em>the greatest</em>&nbsp;challenge,&nbsp;<em>the greatest</em>&nbsp;cause, and&nbsp;<em>the greatest</em> work on earth today". Databases play a huge role in this process.&nbsp;</li>

</ul>
</li>
  </ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Have groups discuss ways 'Big Data' companies might use data to personalize your experience with them. Adding personalization takes a lot of storage.&nbsp; What data might they need to store about each user? Give each group a company to discuss and then share: Amazon, Facebook, Expedia, Google, etc.</li>

<h3>(W03 - ERD and Datatypes Intro):</h3>
<li>Show the ERD that goes with the data they collected the first week of class.</li>
<img src="../text/images/gatherdata-erd.png" alt="ERD for data gathering tables in relational database design" width="500px">
<li>Show the students how you are entering the data they had in their spreadsheet as tables in the database by looking at the ERD you will use. Look at the datatypes you chose and why. Look at the datatype drop down for other types of data and discuss what you might store in some of the other datatypes. Point out how the way the table columns are used in the ERD will reduce data redundancy. They will be learning about the relationships next week. You can leave the relationship crows feet off if you would like or let them know it will be explained next week. This week we just want to show the column attribute arrangements and datatypes used in the ERD.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Remind students of the quiz the second class of the week, there will be a quiz the second day of each week.</li><br>
<li>
<h3>Mid-week</h3>
</li>
<ul>
<li>The quiz this week will be on datatypes and database models.</li>
<li>Have them complete their quiz by themselves once and then with others for the second attempt. The discussions and debates during the second attempt as a group is a great 'teach one another' activity. The two scores will be averaged for their final quiz score.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h3>W03 - SQL Overview</h3>
<li>Use the following database to demonstrate an overview of SQL.</li>
<li><a href="https://cit111byui.github.io/datagathered_dump.sql">datagathered_dump.sql</a></li>

<li>Here is some code to show the students. The students do not need to be able to create any of this code. The purpose is just to show them the code and explain what each does and the purpose of each. Let them know we will learn how to code later in our course. You can let the students download the dump file and practice with it as you show them the statements. I typed the first few with them and went over common syntax errors like forgetting the semi-colon between statements. Also showing hwo to run just one statement at a time in Workbench. The queries that use aggregates, group bys, and joins I just showed them and didn't have them type them in. The point is to show how detailed of questions we can ask the query, not to teach the SQL statements at this point.</li>
<li>This is also a good chance to talk about datatypes and how they allow different data to be entered. For example, the worry_category is VARCHAR and the dist_category followed the categorization of the data gather sheets with ENUM. The query showing the top worries has a result set that is not as succinct since the data entry person wasn't limited on what they could enter. There are misspellings and categories that didn't fit with the worry_cateogy as represented in the data gathering sheet.
</li>
<pre>

SELECT * FROM student;

SELECT lname, fname, major
FROM student
WHERE major = "CIT" and group_id = 2;

SELECT lname, fname
FROM student
WHERE dist_category = "social media";

-- Top distraction category
SELECT dist_category, COUNT(*)
FROM student
GROUP BY dist_category
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

-- Top worry category
SELECT worry_category, COUNT(*)
FROM student
GROUP BY worry_category
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

-- Which group had the most selfies? (I had 2 classes so as I entered data I put a 1 or 2 at the end of location)
SELECT group_name, COUNT(type)
FROM student_group JOIN student
  ON student_group.group_id = student.group_id
  JOIN image
  ON student.student_id = image.student_id
WHERE student_group.location LIKE "%2" AND type="selfie"
GROUP BY group_name
ORDER BY COUNT(type) DESC;

-- Which major had the most documentation type images
SELECT major, COUNT(type)
FROM student
  JOIN image
  ON student.student_id = image.student_id
WHERE type="documentation"
GROUP BY major
ORDER BY COUNT(type) DESC;

        <h1>What Can We Do With Data?</h1>
        <h2>Asking Good Questions</h2>
        <p>
            Just as we can ask good question to guide our lives, organizations must ask good questions in order to get the information they need to make good decisions to achieve success for their organization. Rather than just making decisions based on intuition or observations alone, organizations should use data that has been gathered to make decisions. This is referred to as data-driven decision making. By using data as the basis for decision-making, organizations can avoid bias and false assumptions that lead to poor decision-making.

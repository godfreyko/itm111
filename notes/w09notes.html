                <ul>
                    <li>Have them complete their quiz by themselves once and then with others for the second attempt.
                        The discussions and debates during the second attempt as a group is a great 'teach one another'
                        activity. The two scores will be averaged for their final quiz score.</li>

                        Usually I don't get through all the joins in the practice activity and I finish them here. I
                        just go over the 'More joins'-- the last 4 queries in the practice activity and really try and
                        help them understand them.</li>

    <h2>Week 08 Outcomes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Explain what a function is and its parts and purpose</li>
      <li>Code SQL functions within queries</li>
      <li>Recognize different types of functions and how they might nest</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="beforeTheWeekBegins">
    <h2>Before the Week Begins</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Students will go over preparation materials and complete the preparation check before the first class of the
        week.</li>
      <li>Consider reviewing the teaching tips and suggestions in the CIT111 - W08 Course Group discussion <a

    <h2>During the Week</h2>
      <h3>First of the week:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The students should have completed the preparation materials and check before the first class of the week
            and be ready for learning, activities, and discussions.</li>
          <li>Have student import the magazine database. Take a look at how the magazine database is designed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
        <ul>
          <h4>(W08 - Functions Practice)</h4> 
          <li>Demonstrate, explain and have students follow along with functions. Here are some examples you could use:
          </li><br>
          <li><a href="../sql_code/w08_functions_practice.sql">SQL CODE FOR PRACTICE</a></li>
          <h4>(W08 - Problem Solving)</h4>
          <li>As seen in the next examples, this week is also about problem solving. Also as seen in the last example,
            using functions as parameters of other functions. So not only understanding how functions work and what each
            function returns, but also how to place them together to find solutions to problems. Here is a good article
            that steps through basic problem solving if you'd like to go over it with the students. <a
              href="http://web.mit.edu/be.400/www/problem.htm" target="_blank">web.mit.edu/be.400/www/problem.htm</a>.
            These are steps they will need to use for homework this week.</li>
          <img src="../img/problem_solving.png" width=500px>
          <li>Using the problem solving steps solve the following (might want to go through one of them as a class with all the problem solving steps):</li><br>
          <li><a href="../sql_code/w08_problem_solving.sql">SQL CODE FOR PROBLEM SOLVING PRACTICE</a></li>
          <br>
          <li>Remind students of the quiz on the second class of the week.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Mid-week</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Have them complete their quiz by themselves once and then with others for the second attempt. The
            discussions and debates during the second attempt as a group is a great 'teach one another' activity. The
            two scores will be averaged for their final quiz score.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <h4>(W08 - Workbench Errors):</h4>
          <li>Using the PowerPoint file <a href="../ErrorPractice.pptx">"errorpractice.pptx"</a> and https://buzzin.live
            to see which group can spot the listed error first. (one buzzin device per group) The next slide after each
            error shows the answer. This takes a little practice to figure it all out with timing between the slides and
            buzzin.live but the students have a lot of fun with this one.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>End of the Week</h3>
          <li>The homework due Saturday will be
            <ul>
              <li>Creating a number of queries that use functions.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
  </div>
  <div class="gradingFeedback">
    <h2>Grading/Feedback</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Instructor:</strong> The check and quiz are auto-graded. The homework will be instructor or TA graded
        and will be checking that their queries produce the proper result sets. </li>
      <li>Here is the key:</li><br>
      <li><a href="../sql_code/w08_functions_key.sql">SQL CODE KEY FOR FUNCTIONS QUERIES</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="lookingAhead">
    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Remind students that they have readings and videos to watch and a check to complete before the first class of
        next week to be prepared for the next week.</li>

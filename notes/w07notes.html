    <h2>Week 07 Outcomes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Create single table queries</li>
      <li>Code statements, commands, clauses and keywords that are used in single table queries</li>
      <li>Code using arithmetic, comparison and logical operators</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="beforeTheWeekBegins">
    <h2>Before the Week Begins</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Students will go over preparation materials and complete the preparation check before the first class of the
        week.</li>
      
    </ul>

    <h2>During the Week</h2>
      <h3>First of the week:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The students should have completed the preparation materials and check before the first class of the week
            and be ready for learning, activities, and discussions.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <h4>(W07 - Query Art DB)</h4>
          <li>Because not all student inserted the data into the database properly, have them import the v_art database from
            the dump file so they all have the same database to query from. It's part of the course_databases.sql along with other databases.</li>
          <li>At this point if they have finished their inserts assignment from last week, they can drop the art_gallery database and continue using the v_art this week for single table queries</li>
          <li>They will also use a new bike shop database this week. The students will have all the databases they will use in this course as well. They are all contained in the course_databse.sql file. Reverse
            engineer the new bike database so the students can see the ERD and how it is designed with Database -
            Reverse Engineer.</li>
          <li>With the introduction of the SELECT statement coding order (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT) it's
            good to go over the order of execution order (FROM, WHERE, SELECT, ORDER BY LIMIT). This helps explain why
            you can use an alias in ORDER BY but not WHERE.</li>
          <li>Demonstrate, explain, and have them follow along with examples of querying the v_art and bike databases.
            Here are some examples:</li><br>
            <li>Here is a video of what I'd go over with them in class.</li><br>

          <br>
          <li>Remind students of the quiz on the second day of class this week.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Mid-week</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Have them complete their quiz by themselves once and then with others for the second attempt. The
            discussions and debates during the second attempt as a group is a great 'teach one another' activity. The
            two scores will be averaged for their final quiz score.</li>
        </ul>

          <h4>(W07 - Bike Shop Queries):</h4>
          <a href="https://cit111byui.github.io/case_studies/w07_bike_shop_queries.pdf" target="_blank">Online Draft</a><br>
          <li>Case Study: This activity will be to retrieve the right data from the database for the bike shop owner (these are
            requests from the owner). Have the student complete these on their own or in groups. Here are some examples:
          </li><br>

        <h3>End of the Week</h3>
          <ul>
          <li style="list-style-type: none;"></li>
          <li>The homework due Saturday will be
            <ul>
              <li>A few CRUD commands from last week related to the art_gallery database and creating queries to
                retreive the correct result set from the bike databases. Have the students look at <a
                  href="http://art.ceiwebdev.com/admin/main.php">art.ceiwebdev.com/admin/main.php</a> this is the
                back-end of the system where only admins would create, update or delete data in the system.
                <em>DON'T</em> give login information to the students. They would be able to change data if you do and
                we want to use this only for demonstrating purposes. <a
                  href="../VirtualArtGalleryProjectExplained.pdf">Art Application Explanation</a> This application is
                referenced in this week's Saturday assignment, showing some of the editing and deleting that can be done
                on the back-end of a system.</li><br>
              <li><strong>IMPORTANT! </strong>Again, because students may not have inserted all the data exactly right last week, they got a new v_art (virtual art) database with all the data already inserted from the course_databases.sql dump file this week. From week 7 on, they will use v_art for any queries. This way all students are using the exact same database and data with no surprises. If they are done with their inserting assignment from last week, they can drop the art_gallery database to avoid confusion.</li>

  <ul>
  <li style="list-style-type: none;">
  <ul>
  <li>The following is a video that shows steps to design ward data into an ERD. Let the students lead the design by asking them questions and let them ask you questions, the video is just for ideas. It's more fun if they have discussion about it and are not just watching you do it.</li><br>

<li>Remind students of the quiz the second day of class this week.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mid-week
<ul>
<li>Have them complete their quiz by themselves once and then with others for the second attempt. The discussions and debates during the second attempt as a group is a great 'teach one another' activity. The two scores will be averaged for their final quiz score.</li>

<h2>Grading/Feedback</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instructor:</strong> The check and quiz are auto-graded. The homework will checking their art ERD. Below is the one I came up with. Notice that the dob and dod years are integers. This is because the range of the years accepted in the Year datatype range from 1901 to 2155. Many of the artist were born and died before 1901. See rubrics for grading.</li>

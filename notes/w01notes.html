  <div class="beforeTheWeekBegins">
    <h2>Before the Week Begins</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Students will usually go over preparation materials and the preparation check before the first class of the
        week, but since this first week they will do that before the second class of this week.</li>
      
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="duringTheWeek">
    <h2>During the Week</h2>
        <h3>First of the week:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Introduce the syllabus and course to the students.&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Prepare students for the routine of the course:
            <ul>
              <li>readings with glossary terms, videos, and checks being done before the first class of the week,</li>
              <li>quizzes on the second day of the week, and</li>
              <li>homework due Saturdays.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <h4>(W01 - Data to Decisions):</h4>
          <a href="https://cit111byui.github.io/case_studies/w01_data_to_decisions.pdf" target="_blank">Online Draft</a><br>
          <li>Using the 7 page pdf file at <a
              href="http://cit111byui.github.io/roadsigns.pdf">cit111byui.github.io/roadsigns.pdf</a>, split the shapes
            and individual letters that don't go together into groups among the students and have them make sense of the
            data that is given to them. They must figure out that it is road signs that they are putting together and
            that they only have parts of some of the signs and other groups have the rest. Give them a while to see if
            they can make sense of it. Eventually, (or possibly with subtle hints) someone will go to another group and
            start putting the pieces together. Have a discussion about data, information, knowledge, and decisions with
            the road signs activity.&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Here are the completed signs:</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: none;"><img src="../text/images/signs.png" alt="completed road signs"
              width="300px"></li>
          <li>Here is an image to use if you are teaching remotely or online (in a non-classroom setting):</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: none;"><img src="../rawdata.png" alt="non-classroom image of road signs raw data"
            width="300px"></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>If it's a short first week you may want to introduce the data gathering activity (W01 - Data Gathering -
            see below) and give them the sheets the first day of class so they can start gathering data. They should
            collect 3 days worth of data for Saturday's homework.</li>
          <li>This week they will do their reading, videos and check before the second class of the week (instead of the
            first) (W01 - Check) Have the checks be due before class time.</li>
          <li>They will also have their first quiz that day. The quiz will cover the syllabus, reading, videos, and,
            glossary.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <h3>Mid-week</h3>
        <ul>
          <h4>(W01 - Quiz):</h4>
          <li>Have them complete their quiz by themselves once and then with others for the second attempt.
            The discussions and debates during the second attempt as a group are great 'teach one another'
            opportunities. The two scores will be averaged for their final quiz score.</li>
        </ul>
          <ul>
            <h4>(W01 - Tools in Your Career):</h4>
            <a href="https://cit111byui.github.io/case_studies/w01_tools_in_your_career.pdf" target="_blank">Online Draft</a><br>
            <li>Demonstrate different types of data and tools used in different industries and careers. There are students
            in the course who have knowledge of these tools and can demonstrate if you wish. Or you can just talk about
            each one. Follow up each demonstration with how it ties into databases. For example most of these tools use
            database data as the data that is being analyzed. This is to give relevance of the course to the students
            from so many different majors.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Geospatial
                <ul>
                  <li>(relational databases and Excel) arcGIS (uses SQL behind a GUI interface)</li>

            <li>Have class gather data and record that data in an informal way.&nbsp; (Use these sheets: )<a
              href="https://cit111byui.github.io/files/data_gathering_activities.pdf">
              https://cit111byui.github.io/files/data_gathering_activities.pdf</a></li>
            <li>Some sheets will take 3 days of worth of data gathered. The purpose of this assignment is to let
              the students see that data is all around us and can be gathered in a variety of ways. Data can be used as a
              tool to improve our lives. Once the data is gathered, the students can store this data in a tabular format of their choice.
              This can be spreadsheets for those familiar with spreadsheets, or Word tables, or columns in a Word document, etc. 
              The students will continue with this data next week. Next week there will be a
              Statement of Work that will explain what we will be doing with the data.</li>
          </ul>
    <h3>End of the Week</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The homework due Saturday (W01 - Data in a Tabular Format) will be their gathered data represented in tabular format of their choice.
          </li>
        <a href='https://www.statology.org/tabular-data/'>A site to explain what tabular data is</a>

  <div class="gradingFeedback">
    <h2>Grading/Feedback</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Instructor:</strong> The check and quiz are auto graded. The submitted tabular data homework will need to be instructor or TA graded. 
        Make sure the table(s) have all the data. Give feedback on any data they might be missing. 20 points for gathering all the data and 10 points for entering it into a readable tabular format. 
        The format of their data tables is up to the students.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="lookingAhead">
    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Remind students that they have readings and videos to watch and a check to complete before the first day of
        class to be prepared for the next week. They can watch or read the preparation material at the same time as they are taking the check quiz on Canvas.</li>

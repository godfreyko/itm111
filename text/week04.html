        <h1>4 How Do We Group Data Into Summary Rows?</h1>
            <h2>Data Types</h2>
            <p>
                The type of data that can be stored in relational databases is defined ahead of time. This is referred to as data
                types. Data types are the rules that define what data may be stored and how it is stored. Data types also allow for more efficient
                storage and enable restrictions on data that can be entered into our database; therefore, keeping our data
                consistent and accurate. The following are some of the common relational data types we will be using in our course.
            </p>

            <h3>Numeric Data Types</h3>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>INT</td>
                    <td>Integer (whole number)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>TINYINT</td>
                    <td>Integers at a smaller range -128 to 127 used for Boolean 0 and 1</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>DECIMAL (size, d)</td>
                    <td>Numbers with digits after the decimal point</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>
                In MySQL, INT stands for the integer that represents the whole numbers. An integer can be written without a fractional
            component such as 1, 100, 4, -10, and it cannot be 1.2, 5/3, etc. The size parameter specifies the maximum display width (which is 255).
            </p>
                <p>
                    TINYINT is a very small integer.The size parameter specifies the maximum display width (which is 255).
                </p>
            <p>
                DECIMAL is a exact fixed-point number. The total number of digits is specified in size. The number of digits after the decimal point is specified in the d parameter.
            </p>
        <h2>Summary Queries</h2>
        <p>
            Summary queries are queries that contain one or more aggregate functions.
        </p>
        <h2>Aggregate Functions</h2>
        <p>
            Aggregate functions operate on a set of rows to calculate and return a single value. For example, determining how many rows are returned; adding up values; or finding the highest, lowest, or average values in a column or group of the result set.
        </p>
        <h2>Common SQL Aggregate Functions</h2>

        <h3>THE COUNT() Function Syntax:</h3>
        <h3 class="syntax">COUNT([ALL| DISTINCT] expression)</h3>

        <pre>

 SELECT COUNT(*) AS ‘Number of Employees’
 FROM employees
			</pre>

        <table class="results">
            <tr>
                <th>Number of Employees</th>

                <td>9488</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            The ALL keyword is assumed with aggregate functions. You don’t have to include it. This means all rows are included in the aggregate function, which is the default.
        </p>

        <pre>

 SELECT AVG(ALL prod_price) AS ‘Average Price’
 FROM products
			</pre>

        <p>
            All product prices are included in the average calculation.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can use the DISTINCT keyword instead to include only unique values.
        </p>

        <pre>

 SELECT AVG(DISTINCT prod_price) AS ‘Average Price’
 FROM products
			</pre>

        <p>
            So if there are multiple products with the same price, that price will only be included once in the average calculation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ROUND function rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places
        </p>

            <tr>
                <td>4.52</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <h2>
            Creating Groups
        </h2>
        <p>
            In previous examples the aggregate functions summarized data across all rows in the given table. Creating groups allows you to summarize subsets of table contents.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will use the GROUP BY clause to do this. The <a href="https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-basics/mysql-group-by/">GROUP BY</a> clause is used when you have an aggregate function that you want to use on the grouped data.
        </p><br>
        <h3>SELECT statement with GROUP BY and HAVING clause syntax:</h3>
        <h3 class="syntax">
            SELECT select_list <br> FROM table_source <br> [WHERE search_condition] <br> [GROUP BY group-by_list] <br> [HAVING search_condition] <br> [ORDER BY order_by_list] <br>
        </h3>

        <pre>

 SELECT vendor_id, COUNT(*) AS ‘Number of Products’
 FROM products 
 GROUP BY vendor_id
			</pre>

        <p>
            The GROUP BY clause sorts the data and groups by vendors, then the COUNT function is used to count the number of products for each vendor. So you’d have a count once per vendor rather than for the entire table.
        </p>
        <table class="results">
            <tr>
                <th>vendor_id</th>
                <th>Number of Products</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>021</td>
                <td>15</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>044</td>
                <td>23</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>121</td>
                <td>31</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h2>
            Filtering Groups
        </h2>
        <p>
            The <a href="https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-basics/mysql-having/">HAVING</a> clause also works with aggregate functions and allows you to filter the groups (or in other words specify which groups to include or not include). It works a lot like the WHERE clause but the WHERE clause filters rows and the HAVING clause
            filters groups.
        </p>

        <pre>

 SELECT vendor_id, COUNT(*) AS ‘Number of Products’
 FROM products
 GROUP BY vendor_id
 HAVING COUNT(*) > 20
			</pre>

        <table class="results">
            <tr>
                <th>vendor_id</th>
                <th>Number of Products</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>044</td>
                <td>23</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>121</td>
                <td>31</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            The HAVING clause filters the vendors after they are grouped and shows only the vendors with the number of products over 20.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can use WHERE and HAVING together. If you want to only include product prices greater than $10 and then show the number of products that result grouped by vendors for those vendors who have more than 20 products.
        </p>

        <pre>
 SELECT vendor_id, COUNT(*) AS ‘Number of Products’
 FROM products
 WHERE product_price > 10
 GROUP BY vendor_id
 HAVING COUNT(*)  > 20
			</pre>

        <table class="results">
            <tr>
                <th>vendor_id</th>
                <th>Number of Products</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>

            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            The <a href="https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-basics/mysql-rollup/">ROLLUP</a> operator can be used with grouping and aggregates allowing you to add one or more summary rows to your results. A summary row will show up for every group you have.
        </p>

        <pre>

 SELECT vendor_id, SUM(product_price) AS ‘Total of Product Prices’
 FROM products
 WHERE vendor_id &lt; 15
 GROUP BY vendor_id WITH ROLLUP

        <p>
            The summary row shows up as the bottom row and totals all the totals into a grand total.

        <h2>SELECT Clause Syntax Order</h2>

            The order of how you must write the code.

        <h2>SELECT Order of Execution</h2>
        <p>
            The written order, or the syntax order of how we write a query differs from the order of how the query is actually executed. It’s important to understand the order of execution so you know what results are accessible where.

        <h3>LIMIT</h3>
        <p>
            The data from the entire table(s) is retrieved, then that is filtered by the WHERE criteria. Then that resulting data is grouped and filtered by the HAVING criteria. The columns, calculations or functions that will show up are determined in SELECT. Then
            that resulting data is sorted and then limited.

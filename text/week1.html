        <h1>What is Data?</h1>

            Data are the bits and pieces, like numbers and characters but with no relevance. We can be given this type of data, but without context, it is meaningless to us. We can see, however, the type of data (or datatype) it might be like numbers or characters. 
        </p>

        <p>
            As data is brought together it is given meaning, and can be understood. There are still characters and numbers, but now they are wrapped with meaning, but may still not be relevant. In the example below: The number 80, without any context, does not tell us much about what that number is refering to. 80 with mph gives us context for the number.
        </p>

            Information is a set of data with relevance. At least one person can see the relevance in the data. Because information has relevance it is more than just data. At a certain place in time, or for a certain person the data makes sense. In the example below: We can now see that there is a network of connections between the pieces of information. The different attributes such as type, color, top speed, price and year describe the entity of vehicle.

            Knowledge is information that has been acquired and gives understanding about the importance of the information. Experience with, or study of, this information increases the awareness or comprehension of the individual. This knowledge can then be used to make decisions. Note: Knowledge doesn’t indicate a change in the information, but rather an awareness or understanding of the information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everyone will need to make decisions, whether in a career or in every day life. The ability to understand data and, the process in which it becomes knowledge, is critical. There is a certain way data needs to be organized to give it context and eventually become the type of knowledge that allows correct decision making for growth and change.
        </p>
        <p>
            Decision-making is acting on the knowledge obtained to achieve some benefit. Organizational success depends on these decisions. Systems that these organizations use, must be able to take data, put the data into context, and provide tools for analysis. From this analysis, decisions can be made. A database is designed for just such a purpose. Note: Again, there is no more change or enhancement of the information, but rather now that the information is understood; a decision can be made based on knowledge.
        </p>
        <h2 id="ea">Entities and Attributes</h2> 
        <p>
            As we begin to organize data, we group data into entities. An entity is a person, place, thing or concept about which data can be collected. If I were gathering data about each of the employees in our organization, I might have their phone numbers, addresses, first and last name. Here is what the raw data pieces might look like with random numbers and characters:
        </p>
        <img src="images/dataraw.png" alt="individual characters or numbers randomly placed">
        <p>
            As we begin to put the data into context they have a little bit more meaning to us, but are still not useful information. Data in context might look something like this:
        </p>
        <img src="images/data.png" alt="individual words or groups of numbers randomly placed">
        <p>
            As we organize it, we might put all of the attributes from one employee together; the first and last name that belong to one employee and their phone number and address. Each employee and their information might be grouped with other employees. Each entity is made up of a number of attributes which represent that entity. An attribute describes the facts, details or characteristics of an entity. In our example the entity is an employee and the attributes are the values that go with each employee. They all have the attributes of first name, last name, address, and phone number. Thus information might look something like this:
        </p>
        <img src="images/information.png" alt="employee list with their names, addresses and phone numbers in a neat table">
        <p>
            The data now has content and relevance and can be understood better. But if we had thousands of employees, it might be hard to get the knowledge we need from the information and therefore might make it difficult to make any useful decisions with the data. That is the purpose of a database.
